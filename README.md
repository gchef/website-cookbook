* WordPress (fully tested)
* Textpattern (still WIP)

Requires [bootstrap-cookbook] [1], [apache2-cookbook] [2] & [php-cookbook] [3].
If the websites require MySQL and/or FTP, I recommend  [mysql-cookbook] [4] &
[ftp-cookbook] [5].

You will alsoWhile you're at it, install [apt-cookbook] [6] as well.
You'll thank me later ; ).
